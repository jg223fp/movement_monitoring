\section{Software}
\emph{Start with some text describing the content of the chapter.}\\


\begin{itemize}
    \item Programming Language:  Which one did you use? Why? Briefly explain the tradeoffs between the language you chose and doing the same in assembly language.
    \item Real-Time: Does your device have real-time constraints? What would happen if your code encountered an unexpectedly large delay?
    \item Security: Describe any computer security issues there might be with your device (can it be exploited?) If you say there are no security issues, make sure you explain why
    \item If you use code not written by your group (code found online, libraries, etc) explain what the extra code does, and how your code interfaces with it. Explain how much of the code is original to your group.

\end{itemize}
